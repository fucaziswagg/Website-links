# Website-links
a list of links to website's I've made, hosted on GitHub pages.

1) To Do App - https://wustl-cse204a-sp2024-2.github.io/todo-react-bean/
  -> this site is implemented through React with JSX and CSS files. It allows users to enter tasks into a to do list, which is stored on an API server. They can mark tasks as complete or remove tasks completely from the list. They can order the list alphabetically, based on the date the task was entered, or based on completion stauts of tasks, ascendingly or descendingly. The site is optimized for 375px wide view ports or larger.

2) To Do App - https://wustl-cse204a-sp2024-2.github.io/image-gallery-fucaziswagg/
  -> this site is implemented through html, css, and javascript files. This site is dedicated about Lebron James (a chiildhoodhero of mine) and his career in the NBA. It has a header with a working navigation bar, 2 about sections, the main image gallery section, and a footer. The image gallery is the focal point of the site. Each image has a linear gradient overlay that appears when you hover over one, and upon clicking an image a fullscreen popout of that image will appear where users can scroll through all the images. The site is optimized for 375px wide view ports or larger.

3) Brand Redesign (NOT DONE)- https://wustl-cse204a-sp2024-2.github.io/brand-redesign-fucaziswagg/
  -> company's original site: https://www.scheduleanyone.com/FadedBarbershopLoop/home 
  -> this site is implemented through html and css files. This site is meant to upgrade to the current site of a barbershop business called "Faded" to a professional standard. The goal was to make the website easier to navigate, give it a clear strucuture, and draws users attention to important features. The site will be optimized for 375px wide view ports or larger.

4) Instagram Website Clone - https://wustl-cse204a-sp2024-2.github.io/retro-instagram-clone-fucaziswagg/
  -> this site is implemented through html and css files. This site is meant to implement the visual elements of the older versions instagram's website, so it is missing a lot of functionality as this was not the focal point. However, it has a fixed header with a search bar, a main posts section, and a scrollable suggestions footer and stories sidebar section, which disappears when the viewport is too small. The site is optimized for 375px wide view ports or larger.

5) City Guide - https://wustl-cse204a-sp2024-2.github.io/city-guide-css-fucaziswagg/
  -> this site is implemented through html and css files. This was one of my first websites, and the primary goal was to familiarize myself with html and css. As a city guide for the city of Sacramento, California, it introduces users to the city and offers activities, landmarks, and food spots to experinence. It has an imbeded google map of the city, a header with a functional navigation bar, and a foot with a contact form.
